Microsoft Authentication Library
=====================================

The MSAL library for <platform> gives your app the ability to begin using the [Microsoft Cloud](https://cloud.microsoft.com) by supporting [Microsoft Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/) and [Microsoft Accounts](https://account.microsoft.com).

## Example

This is a 

`few lines of sample code to call the API. Should be aquireToken for whatever platform. Nothing more.`

and larger documentation should go below, but really should be in docs.

## Installation

A few sentences about how to use a package manager to install the library. Also shouldn't go in to deep detail. 

## Samples and Documentation

We provide [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-developers-guide) and [sample applications](https://github.com/Azure-Samples) to help you get started. We also provide docs for authentication flows, accessing the Microsoft Graph, and other awesome features.
